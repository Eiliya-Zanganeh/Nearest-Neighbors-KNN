## What is K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)?

---

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a simple, supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It operates based on the principle that similar data points are located close to each other in feature space. The algorithm classifies a new data point based on the majority class among its K nearest neighbors in the training dataset.

The goal of KNN is to predict the class or value of a new data point based on its proximity to existing points in the dataset.

## Applications of K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

---

* Classification: KNN is commonly used for classification tasks, such as identifying handwritten digits, categorizing news articles, or diagnosing diseases based on patient symptoms.

* Recommendation Systems: KNN can be used to recommend products or services to users based on the preferences of similar users or items.

* Anomaly Detection: The algorithm can help identify outliers or anomalies in the dataset by measuring the distance from normal data points.

## Advantages of K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

---

* Simplicity: KNN is easy to understand and implement, making it a good choice for beginners in machine learning.

* No Training Phase: KNN does not require an explicit training phase, as it stores all the training data and makes decisions based on it at prediction time.

* Adaptability: KNN can be used for both classification and regression tasks, making it a versatile algorithm.

## Disadvantages of K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

---

* Computationally Intensive: KNN can be slow for large datasets, as it requires calculating the distance to all training samples for each prediction.

* Sensitivity to Feature Scaling: The algorithm is sensitive to the scale of the features, making it necessary to normalize or standardize the data before using KNN.

* Choice of K: The performance of KNN can be sensitive to the choice of the parameter K, which requires careful tuning to achieve optimal results.
